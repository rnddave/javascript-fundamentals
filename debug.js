Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: 

syntax errors that prevent your program from running, 
runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, 
logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

// JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.
