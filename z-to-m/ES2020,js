// I think a lot of new things in ES2020

// bigInt
// nullish coalescing operation
// optional chaining operation 
// Promise.allSettled
// globalThis

// BigInt = new data type

typeof 4;       // number
typeof Infinity;        // number

typeof 1n;      // bigint
// want to know more?   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/307179/what-is-javascripts-highest-integer-value-that-a-number-can-go-to-without-losin

// used when we have a number greater than the max-safe-integer

number1 = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ;     // 9007199254740991

// essentially the most JS can hold in memory (using the integer data type) 

/*
number1 = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ; 
9007199254740991

bigNum = number1 + Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
18014398509481982

typeof bigNum; 
'number'

bigerNum = bigNum * bigNum;
3.2451855365842665e+32

typeof bigerNum
'number'

// some really unexpected answer above, mostly, why it stays as a type number tbh.

// ----------- Optional Chaining Operation ------------ \\ 


// so first we assume we have 2 similar objects: 

let myPokemon = {
    pikachu: {
        species: 'mouse pokemon',
        height: 0.4,
        weight: 6.2
    }
}

let myPokemon2 = {
    raichu: {
        species: 'mouse pokemon',
        height: 0.8,
        weight: 19.2
    }
}

let weight = myPokemon.pikachu.weight;
console.log(weight);

let weight2 = myPokemon2.pikachu.weight;
console.log(weight2); // this will result in a failure, because myPokemon2 does not have the Pikachu object)

// so in the old ways, and in some old code, you will see that there are these checks that work through the object: 
if (myPokemon2.pikachu && myPokemon2.pikachu.weight) { // if myPokemon2.pikachu exists AND .....
    let weight2 = myPokemon2.pikachu.weight // then weight 2 = this
} else {
    let weight2 = undefined                 // else it is undefined 
}

// this doesn't look nice, is complicated and can add a lot of code to your program
// new way to do it... 

let weight3 = myPokemon2?.pikachu?.weight;  // the ? is saying 'is there a myPokemon2? then is there a pikachu? then is there a weight
console.log(weight3);   // undefined
                        // so it doesn't throw an error, it gives the undefined. 
                        // it allows you to ask if a property exists 
                        // doesn't need the long complex if statements
