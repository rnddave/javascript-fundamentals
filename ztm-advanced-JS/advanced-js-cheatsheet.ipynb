    "JavaScript Engine\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A JavaScript engine is a computer program that you give JavaScript code to and it tells the computer how to execute it. Basically a translator for the computer between JavaScript and a language that the computer understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens inside of the engine? Well, that depends on the engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many JavaScript Engines out there and typically they are created by web browser vendors. All engines are standardized by ECMA Script or **ES**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[List of JavaScript Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines)\n",
    "\n",
    "![javascript engine](https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/3o7Q3edCrVJG9Zzj6VMZ1K/28136a643636dfa04090f3fb5c5467ff/javascript_engine.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Nifty Snippet**: 2008 was a pivotal moment for JavaScript when Google created the Chrome V8 Engine.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The V8 engine is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine, written in C++ and used in the Chrome browser and powers Node JS.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The performance outmatched any engine that came before it mainly because it combines 2 parts of the engine, the interpreter and the compiler. Today, all major engines use this same technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parser\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing is the process of analyzing the source code, checking it for errors, and breaking it up into parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AST\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser produces a data structure called the **Abstract Syntax Tree** or **AST**.\n",
    "\n",
    "AST is a tree graph of the source code that does not show every detail of the original syntax, but contains structural or content-related details. Certain things are implicit in the tree and do not need to be shown, hence the title abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interpreter\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter directly executes each line of code line by line, without requiring them to be compiled into a machine language program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreters can use different strategies to increase performance. They can parse the source code and execute it immediately, translate it into more efficient machine code, execute precompiled code made by a compiler, or some combination of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the V8 engine, the interpreter outputs bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Nifty Snippet**: The first JavaScript engine was written by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, in 1995 for the Netscape navigator web browser. Originally, the JavaScript engine only consisted of an interpreter. This later evolved into the SpiderMonkey engine, still used by the Firefox browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compiler\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler works ahead of time to convert instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed by a computer. It runs all of the code and tries to figure out what the code does and then compiles it down into another language that is easier for the computer to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you heard of Babel or TypeScript?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are heavily used in the Javascript ecosystem and you should now have a good idea of what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Babel** is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typescript** is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript. Both of these do exactly what compilers do. Take one language and convert into a different one!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Combo\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern engines, the interpreter starts reading the code line by line while the **profiler** watches for frequently used code and flags then passes is to the compiler to be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the JavaScript engine takes the bytecode the interpreter outputs and mixes in the optimized code the compiler outputs and then gives that to the computer. This is called \"Just in Time\" or **JIT** Compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Nifty Snippet**: Back in 1995 we had no standard between the browsers for compiling JavaScript. Compiling code on the browser or even ahead of time was not feasible because all the browsers were competing against each other and could not agree on an executable format.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Even now, different browsers have different approaches on doing things. Enter **WebAssembly** a standard for binary instruction (executible) format. [Keep your eye on WebAssembly](/courses/learn-webassembly) to help standardize browsers abilities to exectute JavaScript in the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Optimized Code\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write code that helps the compiler make its optimizations, not work against it making the engine slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization is a way to cache a return value of a function based on its parameters. This makes the function that takes a long time run much faster after one execution. If the parameter changes, it will still have to reevaluate the function.\n"

    "\n",
    "Functions are objects in JavaScript, which is not true for other languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "Every function in JavaScript automatically gets a **prototype** property when it is created that gives it the call, apply, and bind methods.\n",

    "Functional Programming\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming has the same goals in mind as object oriented programming, to keep your code understanable, easy to extend, easy to maintain, memory efficient, and DRY.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of objects, it uses reusable functions to create and act on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is based on a separation of concerns similar to object oriented programming. However, in functional programming, there is a complete separation between the data and the behaviors of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an idea that once something is created, it should not be changed, being **immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike OOP, shared state is avoided as functional programming works on the idea of **pure functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pure function** has no side effects to anything outside of it and given the same input will always output the same value. They do not change any data passed into them, but create new data to return without altering the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not possible to have 100% pure functions. At some point you need to interact with the dom or fetch an api.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even _console.log_ makes a function unpure because it uses the window object outside of the function. The fact is a program cannot exist without side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the goal of functional programming is to minimize side effects by isolating them away from the data. Build lots of very small, reusable and predictable pure functions that do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Complete 1 task per function.\n",
    "*   Do not mutate state.\n",
    "*   Do not share state.\n",
    "*   Be predictable.\n",
    "*   Be composable, one input and one output.\n",
    "*   Be pure if possible.\n",
    "*   Return something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referential transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "One important concept of functional programming is **referential transparency**, the ability to replace an expression with the resulting value without changing the result of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    function a(num1, num2) {\n",
    "      return num1 + num2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    function b(num) {\n",
    "      return num * 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b(a(3, 4)); // 14\n",
    "    // a should always return 7\n",
    "    // so it could be changed to\n",
    "    b(7); // 14\n",
    "    // and the output is the same\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idempotence\n",
    "\n",
    "Idempotence is another important piece of functional programming. It is the idea that given the same input to a function, you will always return the same output. The function could be used over and over again and nothing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you make your code predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imperative vs Declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imperative programming** tells the computer what to do and how to complete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declarative programming** only tells the computer what to do, but not how to do things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans are declarative by nature, but computers typically need more imperative type programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using higher level languages like JavaScript is actually being less declarative. This is important in function programming because we want to be more declarative to better understand our code and let the computer handle the dirty work of figuring out the best way to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "![imperative code](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/5nFLOTAXwQRDSb2WDlJSFN/bb8d98271f6f1e491142d11249557b76/imperative_code.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "    arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability is simply not modifying the original data or **state**. Instead we should create copies of the state inside our functions and return a new version of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Bad code\n",
    "    const obj = {name: 'Brittney'}\n",
    "    \n",

    "    console.log(`obj = ${obj}`, `updatedNameObj = ${updatedNameObj})\n",
    "    // obj = {name: 'Brittney'} updatedNameObj = {name: 'Joe'}\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be thinking that this could get really expensive, memory wise, to just copy code over and over. However, there is something called **structural sharing** that allows the data to only copy new information and points to the original state for any commonalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![structure tree](https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/7hMhPpSyzvev3ERSpooIC3/6e2b4401726e627db5777f1bde116148/structure_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial application is expanding on the idea of currying and taking it a step farther by separating a parameter out. If you have more than 2 arguments in a functions, then you can **bind** one of them to a value to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    const multiply = (a, b, c) => a * b * c;\n",
    "    const curriedMultiplyBy5 = multiply.bind(null, 5); // this is null\n",
    "    \n",
    "    curriedMultiplyBy5(4, 10); // 200\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipe and Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript it is best for speed and efficiency to keep functions small and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function composition is the idea that you lay out your functions like a factory assembly line. The actual functions **pipe()** and **compose()** don't actually exist in JavaScript yet, but there are many libraries that use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can however create your own versions of them. The **compose()** function reads the functions from right to left and the **pipe()** function will read from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "    // create our own COMPOSE function\n",
    "    const compose = (fn1, fn2) => data => fn1(fn2(data));\n",

    "> **Nifty Snippet**: The **Pipeline Operator** is in the experimental stage 1 of being introduced to JavaScript.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Stage 1 means that it has only started the process and could be years before it is a part of the language. The pipeline operator, **|>**, would be syntactic sugar for composing and piping functions the long way.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Arity\n",
    "\n",
    "Arity simply means the number of arguments a function takes. The more parameters a function has the harder it becomes to break apart and reuse. Try to stick to only 1 or 2 parameters when writing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "So, is functional programming the answer to everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, but it is great in situations where you have to perform different operations on the same set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming just lays the foundation for creating reusable functions that can be moved around as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is great in areas of industry and machine learning and it is even in some front end libraries like React and Redux. Redux really popularized functional programming for JavaScript developers.\n",

    "Composition vs Inheritance\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition** is what we just did with FP, creating small reusable functions to make code modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is what we did with OOP, creating a class and extending it to subclasses that inherit the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP we create few operations on common data that is stateful with side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FP we create many operations on fixed data with pure functions that don't mutate state. There is a big debate over which one is better and most people believe that composition is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the drawbacks to inheritance is that it is based on the fact that it won't change, we tell it what it is. We create a class and give it properties and methods that describe the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But say, down the road, we need to update that class and add more functionality. Adding a new method to the base class will create rippling effects through your entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "FP is more declarative, what to do not how, and OOP is more imperative, what and how to do something. This is the **tight coupling** problem, things having to depend on one another, which leads to the **fragile base class** problem, seemingly safe changes cause unforeseen repercussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the opposite of small reusable code. Changing one small thing in either of the class or subclasses could break the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is **hierarchy** where you may need to create a subclass that can only do 1 part of the class, but instead you get everything passed down to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is probably a better tool to use when creating programs because it creates a more stable environment that is easier to change in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to decide which structure is better for your project. You can use ideas from both of these styles to write your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "React uses OOP in class components to extend inheritance and then uses FP in the pure components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in JavaScript\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are pieces of code, grouped together, that can be combined together to create an expandable program that can get bigger as it needs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good modules are self contained and grouped together with their own specific functionality allowing them to be moved or deleted without breaking the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally in JavaScript, we had the **module pattern**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before block scope came around, there was only global scope and function scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this idea of modules, a **module scope** was implemented just above the function scope. This allowed variables to be shared, by exporting and importing, between the functions without having to go through the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function as a module is essentially just an immediately invoked function expression, IIFE.\n",
    "\n",
    "    var globalScopeVar = \"I can be accessed anywhere\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    var moduleName = (function(globalScopeVar) {\n",
    "      // add private variables here\n",
    "      var privateVar = \"I cannot be accessed outside\";\n",
    "      // create the function\n",
    "      function say(msg1, msg2) {\n",
    "        var say1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg1.length);\n",
    "        var say2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg2.length);\n",
    "        return say1 > say2 ? say1 : say2;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      globalScopeVar = `I don't change the outside scope`;\n",
    "      // return only what you want the outside to access\n",
    "      return {\n",
    "        say: say\n",
    "      };\n",
    "    })(globalScopeVar);\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though modules help us to contain and organize code, there are still problems that can arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be naming conflicts if you don't use const to declare the module. Also, there are dependency issues if scripts are placed in the wrong order, such as jQuery needing to be called before it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these problems, people started developing libraries to solve them. Before ES6 we had 2 ways to implement modules in JavaScript **CommonJS** and **AMD**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CommonJS** - uses the keywords **require** and **exports** to interact with the module system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Require is a function used to import from another module and exports is an object where functions get exported from. These are run synchronously where we wait on one module to load before another can start and this is not ideal for browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this code may look familiar because NodeJS still uses this library. There are other packages such as Browserify and webpack that aid in bundling scripts with CommonJS to be used in the browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)** - as in the name, AMD loads modules asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was great for browsers early on before packages that bundled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "_define(\\['module1', 'module2'\\], function(module1, module2) {console.log(module1.setName());});_\n",
    "\n",
    "The **define** function takes an array of dependency modules that are loaded in a non-blocking manner in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once completed, the callback function is then executed. Packages came out like RequireJS thatimplemented the AMD endpoint and was the main way people used AMD modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ES6 Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "After ES6 came out, pretty much everything above was thrown out the window with 2 new keywords. We can now use the **import** and **export** keywords in our files to implement modules. This again may look familiar from popular frameworks like React.\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",

    "One of the most important things to learn in being a developer is how to solve errors. Learning to handle errors makes you a better programmer.\n",
    "\n",

    "Throwing a new error in asynchronous code gets what is called a silent fail if there is no catch block present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In synchronous code, if there is no catch statement placed in the code, the runtime will create _catch: onerror()_ and we see the built in JavaScript error message in red.\n",

    "This is the \"official\" end of the Advanced JavaScript section, but Brittney added a small section of her notes on [data structures and algorithms](/courses/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/) because they are an important part of developing great programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures and algorithms are the fundamentals of every program.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Data structures are collections of values\n",
    "*   Algorithms are the steps we put in place to manipulate the data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what language you write in, [if you understand these two things](/courses/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/), you have the ability to write great programs.\n",

    "### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure is different types of containers that hold your data. Each container has its own type of data it holds and is specfic to that type. You want to be able to easily access your data and know where it is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basically a way to organize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to data structures: how to build one and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do computers work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer has many parts but 3 that run almost all of our everyday operations, the CPU, RAM, and a hard drive (storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU processes all the data and only has so much power, the RAM is memory that is temporarily delegated to programs, and a hard drive is persistent memory that stays where we put it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent storage is quiet slow, so we need RAM to use as a temporary holder for memory. RAM is like a storage shelf of memory addresses that each contain 8 bits or 1 byte. Each bit is either a 0 or a 1 to indicate whether it is on or off, 1 for on and 0 for off.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bit](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/6jmj5ELnBi1N1a1EzThZbL/4973780388a30be9b364cf5f8a19a151/bit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many implementations of data structures out there but there are only 2 fundamental kinds, array of contiguous memory locations and linked structures, or you can combine the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important ones you will run into are arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, tries, graphs, and hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "With algorithms there are sorting, dynamic programming, BFS + DFS (Searching), and recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data structure has things they are good at and may be better in certain situations than others. Below is a list of data structures that are built into several popular languages. That doesn't mean that you can't use other types, you just have to build our own. Such as if JavaScript doesn't have stacks, we can build one.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays order items sequentially with an index. Arrays are probably the simplest and the most widely used data structure because the are fast and take up the least amount of space. They also have the least amount of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array methods have different time complexities, called Big-Order or [Big-O notations](https://youtu.be/TUiv2UgDgOQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_O(1) is constant time, meaning the time does not change with the data input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \\_O(n) is linear time, meaning time changes or goes up the more operations that need to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_O(1) can end up as \\_O(n) in languages like JavaScript if it needs to allocate more memory for the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also, Big-Omega or Big-Ω notation that give the best possible time for your program. If a program has the same time complexity in Big-O and in Big-Ω, then you can use θ as shorthand for both combined.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Hash tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Different languages have different names for a hash table, but in JavaScript a hash table is an object. A data structure that stores data in key/value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash function\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function takes a key and maps it to a value of fixed length for every input.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an indempotent function meaning given the same input the output will always be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table uses the hash function to compute the key into a hash code and map that to an address in memory where it is stored with the value in a **bucket**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the hashing technique makes looking up data inside the hash table very fast and is usually _O(1)_ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    let character = {\n",
    "      age: 20,\n",
    "      name: \"Harry Potter\",\n",
    "      muggle: false,\n",
    "      patronus: function() {\n",

    "    character.patronus(); // Expecto Patronum! // O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data structure is going to come with downsides. Hash collisions are what happens when a hash function maps a key to the same address as a previously added key.\n",
    "\n",
    "With enough data and limited memory, we will always run into this collision. This does not overwrite the previous information, but creates a linked list and slows down our ability to access the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your big O notation time jumps from O(1) to O(n/k) where n is the time and k is the size of the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hashing in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript came out with 2 ways to help prevent hash collisions when implenting hash tables, the **Map** object and the **Set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map will store key/value pairs like an object, but will remember the original order in memory. A Map also allows for any data type to be stored as a key such as an array or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Set will only store the values and also remembers the original order, but the values may only occur once.\n",
